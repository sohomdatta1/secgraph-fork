Community Enhanced De-anonymization of Online Social Networks

The deAnon code is in java. You may consider any of the "code/deAnon/Comm_Enhanced.java" or "code/deAnon/Comm_Blind.java" as the main file to run.

To get degree of anonymity in addition to success and error rates:

First, run exps with Prob/Deg parameter as False, to compute the probabilities.
Then, average the probabilities and run the exps with Prob/Deg parameter as True. 



To run the code, you should have: 

1) added jung 2.0.1 lib to the project

2) network files in pajek format,

3) run infomap (http://www.tp.umu.se/~rosvall/code.html) to get communities for each network,

4) run find-cliques.py to get cliques of the original network.



Notes:

	- You may use "code/"re-wiring-edges.jar" to re-wire the edges and generate noisy networks

	- You may use "code/deAnon/graph/OverlappedGraphs.java" to generate two overlapped networks from a reference network.
